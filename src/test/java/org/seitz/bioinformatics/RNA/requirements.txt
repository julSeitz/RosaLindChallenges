Accepts a string representing a DNA sequence, of a maximum length of 1000 nucleotides.
Only the symbols  'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are valid. Each represents one of the nucleotides found in DNA.
Transcribes the DNA sequence into an RNA sequence by replacing every instance of 'T' (thymine), with 'U' (uracil).
Returns the corresponding RNA sequence as a string
